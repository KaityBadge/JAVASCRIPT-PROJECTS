# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS

## Welcome!
- This is my first experience using JavaScript!
- I will be storing projects from the online JavaScript course through The Tech Academy.

## Goals
- I aim to learn a whole new coding language from square one.
- I want to add functionality and increase interactivity of my personal portfolio which, right now, is built purely with CSS and HTML
