# JavaScript Projects

Hey there!
This repository is a collections of some of my very first projects using JavaScript. Each one represents a step in my learning journey
from building interactive UI elements to creating complete mini applicaitons. 

### What's Inside: 
Here's a quick look at some of the projects you'll find in this repo:
- **🎫🎬Academy Cinemas**
  A simple mock movie theatre interface where users can view movies, pick show times, and reserve seats.

  Build-your-own pizza! Choose toppings and see your custome pie and price update in real time.
- **🍴Simple Recipes**
  A recipe display page -- browse and explore simple meals with a clean UI and DOM interaction.

  The classic game of tic-tac-toe -- now in your browser! Includes win detection and a reset feature.

  A link to the personal portfolio site I created to showcase my work and skills.
