        <h2> Creating an HTML Event</h2>
            <p> This is the onlick attribute. <br>
            I will create a button and attatch JavaScript code to it <br>
            so it will display the date and time.</p>
            <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()"> Click Here for the date and time </button>

        <h2> Another Example of an HTML Event</h2>
            <p>This is the onmouse over attribute. <br>
            When the user moves their mouse over the following text <br>
            it will display in a different color </p>
            <h3 id="demo" onmouseover="mouseOver()"> Move your mouse over this text!</h3>
            <p> The text will stay red until I create another event<br>
            That event is called mouseout, it is be applied the same way </p>
            <h3 id="demo2" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut()"> Move your mouse over this text!</h3>
